### Rapier 2D and 3D experiments
This fork is part of my time travel experiments for Convey. (Note to self: See the developer diary entries for around August 18th/2021 for some more context). The focus of each physics engine evaluations is:
 - Ensure it supports deterministic running
 - Ensure it supports snapshotting/serializing 
 - Build at least one demo proving/disproving it meets our requirements.

Current working demo: https://conveyhq.github.io/rapier.js/cannonball/

Build/run testbed2 or testbed3 to see all the demos. 
```
git clone git@github.com:seflless/rapier.js.git
cd testbed3d
# or testbed2d
npm install
npm start
# The demos should auto launch in your default browser.
```
